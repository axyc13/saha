            Saha is built on a simple idea: <b>people first.</b> Our culture is
            rooted in integrity, support, humility, and clear thinking. These
            values guide our work and shape how we show up for our clients, our
            partners, and each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team brings experience across finance, accounting, analytics,
            and business strategy  but more importantly, we bring perspective.
            We stay calm under pressure, focus on true understanding, and always
            aim to do the right thing, even when no one is watching.
          </p>
          <p>
            We&apos;re lifelong learners, critical thinkers, and disciplined
            executors. We get things done and we do them well.
